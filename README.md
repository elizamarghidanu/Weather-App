# Weather App

This is a weather app that allows you to view the weather forecast for the next 7 days for your current location. The app uses your device's geolocation feature to retrieve your location, and then makes use of the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather forecast data.

### Installation

To use the app, simply download the 3 files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`. You can then open the index.html file in your web browser to start using the app.

### Usage

When you first open the app, it will request permission to access your location. Once you grant permission, the app will retrieve your location and display the weather forecast for your current location. The forecast includes the temperature, weather conditions, and the forecast for the next 7 days. I am still working on being able to view the forecast for a different location by entering the desired location into the search bar at the top of the page.
